# **Statistical Experimentation with R Internal Datasets**
---
## **Overview**

This project demonstrates statistical experimentation using R's built-in datasets to explore a range of statistical techniques and visualization methods. The focus is on providing a comprehensive, hands-on understanding of:
- Experimental design
- Statistical tests (ANOVA, correlation, factorial design)
- Error simulations (Type I & II errors)
- Data visualization
- Statistical methodologies

This project aims to help students and practitioners in statistics as it did for me, as far as understand the **why** behind various experimental design decisions, statistical test choices, and visualization techniques is concerned. The project drew [**inspiration**](): from a DataCamp course I have just completed.

## **Project Structure**

The project consists of three key documents (in Quarto format) that together explain, explore, and present the methodologies and results of statistical experimentation:

### 1. **Why Statistical Experimentation: Methodologies and Concepts**

This document explains the **why** behind each statistical technique used in the analysis, providing an in-depth understanding of the following:
- The purpose of using R internal datasets like `PlantGrowth`, `mtcars`, and `iris`.
- The rationale for choosing specific statistical methods such as ANOVA, correlation, and factorial designs.
- Why certain visualizations were selected for interpretation.
- Addressing the importance of understanding errors and biases in statistical experiments.

### 2. **Exploratory Statistical Experimentation with R Internal Datasets**

This document includes all the **code** used to perform statistical analyses on the datasets. It covers:
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical tests: One-way ANOVA, correlation testing, and factorial design
- Simulations of Type I and Type II errors
- Custom visualizations: boxplots, scatterplots, and interaction plots

### 3. **Results and Interpretations: Statistical Experimentation in R**

This document presents the **results** of the statistical tests and visualizations, providing detailed interpretations of the findings:
- Summaries of test results (e.g., ANOVA tables, correlation coefficients)
- Visual interpretations from the plots
- Discussion of the implications of each experiment

## **How to Run the Project**

### **Prerequisites**

- **R** (version 4.0 or higher)
- **Quarto** (for rendering Quarto documents)
- **R packages**:
  - `ggplot2` (for visualizations)
  - `dplyr` (for data manipulation)
  - `stats` (for statistical functions)
  
To install the necessary R packages, run the following command in R:
```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "stats"))
```

---

### **Steps to Render the Documents**

1. **Clone the Repository** or download the project files.
2. Ensure that **Quarto** is installed. If not, follow the instructions on the [Quarto website](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).
3. Open a terminal (or RStudio) and navigate to the project directory.
4. Render each of the Quarto documents using the following commands:

   To render the **Methodologies and Concepts** document:
   ```bash
   quarto render why-methods.qmd
   ```

   To render the **Code and Exploratory Analysis** document:
   ```bash
   quarto render code-analysis.qmd
   ```

   To render the **Results and Interpretations** document:
   ```bash
   quarto render results.qmd
   ```

5. The rendered documents will be outputted in HTML or PDF format, depending on the configuration.

## **Key Concepts Covered**

### 1. **Statistical Tests**
- **One-Way ANOVA**: Used to compare means across different groups (e.g., plant growth under different conditions).
- **Correlation Analysis**: Measures the strength of a relationship between two continuous variables.
- **Factorial Design**: Explores interactions between multiple factors (e.g., engine type and cylinder count on car mileage).

### 2. **Error Simulation**
- **Type I Error**: False positive, rejecting a true null hypothesis.
- **Type II Error**: False negative, failing to reject a false null hypothesis.
  
### 3. **Visualizations**
- **Boxplots**: Visualize distribution and outliers of data.
- **Scatterplots**: Display relationships between continuous variables.
- **Interaction Plots**: Show how two factors interact in influencing a dependent variable.
